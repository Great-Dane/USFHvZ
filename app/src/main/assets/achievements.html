	<div class="node-content"><p>Returning for their 2nd semester are Achievements, a unique part of USF HvZ. These are tracked by moderators and used for glory and bragging rights.<br /><br />
Achievements are various tasks and accomplishments that usually involve a break from standard gameplay to do something extra or odd. The first player to earn each achievement is listed on this page and announced on Facebook. Rezycler keeps a list of everyone who completes it.<br /><br />
They are broken down into General (achievements for all players), Human Only, and Zombie Only achievements.<br /><br />
After the game, all that attend the HvZ Post Game Banquet receive Achievement Sheets and are awarded with stickers for all of the achievements they completed from the game.<br /><br />
The player who earns the most General achievements also earns a special prize towards the NEXT semester's game of HvZ. </p>
