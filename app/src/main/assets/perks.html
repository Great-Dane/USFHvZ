<p><strong><big><span style="color:#D30B0B">Swashbuckler</span></big></strong></p>
<p>- This player is given a melee weapon that can stun zombies, but unable to use any other form of defenses (no socks, blowguns, or blasters etc are to be used, but may be carried by the swordsman). They also wear a bright orange jersey.<br />
- The melee weapon can stun or restun any zombie, other than an active Cannonball Zombie.<br />
- The Swashbuckler is also given a flag football belt. This player only dies when the flag is pulled. Zombie perks still normally affect this player.<br />
-When the Swashbuckler dies, that player becomes a zombie. The human side is reissued out a new Swashbuckler perk at the beginning of the next mission.</p>
<p><strong><big><span style="color:#D30B0B">Writ of Passage</span></big></strong><br />
-This is a short period of time that makes a human immune to tags. During this time you may not stun a zombie or interact with objectives.<br />
-When earned by a human, they must declare a time for the Writ of Passage to be used. During that time, they then are given a white flag to wave and a pass that gives them safe passage.<br />
-Writs of Passage will never allowed to be scheduled during the first 20 minutes a mission is scheduled for.<br />
-Active Writs may not impede or physically stop zombies, remember to not be a Jerk. </p>
<p><strong><big><span style="color:#D30B0B">Immunity Cards</span></big></strong></p>
<p>- Upon being tagged, the player presents their Immunity Card to the zombie that tagged them. This zombie may keep or tear up the card, but it may not be used again.<br />
- Once activated, the human remains a human and has 15 seconds of immunity before being able to be tagged again. Returning to gameplay (throwing socks, shooting nerf, or handling objectives) forfeits this immunity.<br />
- Immunity Cards may not be stacked, traded, or rediscovered. Once you have lost an Immunity Card, you may never possess another.<br />
-Legend tells of 7 Immunity Cards lost to the Blood Moon that still haunt the grounds of Tampa to this very day.</p>

<p><strong><big><big>ZOMBIE PERKS</big></big></strong></p>
<p><strong><big><span style="color:#D30B0B">Cannonball Zombie</span></big></strong></p>
<p>- The Cannonball Zombie is a zombie that wears a green jersey with a C on it. Even though they must always wear the jersey, the perk can only be activated DURING A MISSION.<br />
-  While unstunned during a mission, this player can signal a nearby mod to begin counting to 3. During this count and afterwards, the zombie is immune to stuns. After the count, the Cannonball zombie is shot forwards and may tag any human in arms reach, and only becomes stunned upon hitting an obstacle.<br />
- Once fired, the Cannonball Zombie MUST RUN IN A STRAIGHT LINE. A mod will call at what obstacle they are stunned. Deviation from the path will stun the zombie.<br />
-(For Real, People who purposefully impede the cannonball is a safety concern and will not be tolerated. You will be turned, no matter what perk you have.) </p>
<p><strong><big><span style="color:#D30B0B">Scurvy Zombie</span></big></strong></p>
<p>-This player wears a green jersey with an S on it.<br />
-The Scurvy Zombie is given a Scurve Ball that gives Scurvy to any human it touches. Humans with Scurvy are disarmed, and cannot defend themself for 1 minute.<br />
-Only the Scurvy Zombie may handle the Scurve Ball.<br />
-Touching a Scurve Ball on the floor or weapon hits still disarm humans.</p>
<p><strong><big><span style="color:#D30B0B">Zombie Respawn Token</span></big></strong></p>
<p>- This token, once given to a moderator, allows a Stunned Zombie to instantly respawn at the moderator and become a unstunned zombie again.<br />
- Moderators have the right to deem a respawn unfair and must be a certain distance from active humans.<br />
- Perked zombies may not use zombie respawn tokens.</p>
<p><strong><big><big>Objectives</big></big></strong></p>
<p>-Immunity card holders and Zombie Respawn Token Holders are allowed to interact with objectives.<br />
-All other Perks may not interact with objectives.<br />
            -Selfie posters and challenges are not objectives, BUT the actual final treasures on each side are objectives and             may not be collected by those with these perks.</p>
